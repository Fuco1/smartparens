;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some additional configuration for Python based
;; modes.  To use it, simply add:
;;
;; (require 'smartparens-python)
;;
;; into your configuration.  You can use this in conjunction with the
;; default config or your own configuration.
;;
;; If you have good ideas about what should be added please file an
;; issue on the github tracker.

;;; Code:

(require 'smartparens)

;; Python has no sexp suffices.  This fixes slurping
;; (|sys).path.append---the dot should not travel with the closing
;; paren
(--each '(python-mode inferior-python-mode)
  (add-to-list 'sp-sexp-suffix (list it 'regexp "")))

(provide 'smartparens-python)
