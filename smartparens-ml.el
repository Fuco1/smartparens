;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some additional configuration for ML languages.
;; To use it, simply add:
;;
;; (require 'smartparens-ml)
;;
;; into your configuration.  You can use this in conjunction with the
;; default config or your own configuration.
;;
;; If you have good ideas about what should be added please file an
;; issue on the github tracker.
