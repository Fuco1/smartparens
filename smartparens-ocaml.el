;;; Code:

(require 'smartparens)

;; This fixes slurping from adding space before or after "." if not needed
;;
;;   Forward-slurp:
;;     UNWANTED: 
;;       (foo) List.map  ~~> (foo List).map ~~ (foo List .map)
;;     EXPECTED:
;;       (foo) List.map  ~~> (foo List).map ~~ (foo List.map)
;;
;;   Backward-slurp:
;;     UNWANTED: 
;;       List.map (foo) ~~> List(.map foo) ~~> (List .map foo)
;;     EXPECTED:
;;       List.map (foo) ~~> List(.map foo) ~~> (List.map foo)
