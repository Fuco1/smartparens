;;; Commentary:

;; Smartparens is minor mode for Emacs that deals with parens pairs
;; and tries to be smart about it.  It started as a unification effort
;; to combine functionality of several existing packages in a single,
;; compatible and extensible way to deal with parentheses, delimiters,
;; tags and the like.  Some of these packages include autopair,
;; textmate, wrap-region, electric-pair-mode, paredit and others.  With
;; the basic features found in other packages it also brings many
;; improvements as well as completely new features.

;; For a basic overview, see github readme at

:end-suf   - point in buffer after the suffix of this expression
:op        - opening delimiter
:cl        - closing delimiter
:op-l      - length of the opening pair
:cl-l      - length of the closing pair
:len       - length of the entire expression, including enclosing
             delimiters, the prefix and the suffix
:len-out   - length of the the pair ignoring the prefix and suffix,
             including delimiters
:len-in    - length of the pair inside the delimiters
:prefix    - expression prefix
:prefix-l  - expression prefix length
:suffix    - expression suffix
:suffix-l  - expression suffix length

These special \"functions\" are expanded to do the selected
action in the context of currently queried pair:

Nullary:
\(sp-do-del-op) - remove prefix and opening delimiter
\(sp-do-del-cl) - remove closing delimiter and suffix

Unary:
\(sp-do-move-op p) - move prefix and opening delimiter to point p
\(sp-do-move-cl p) - move closing delimiter and suffix to point p
\(sp-do-put-op p) - put prefix and opening delimiter at point p
\(sp-do-put-cl p) - put closing delimiter and suffix at point p

In addition to these simple queries and commands, this macro
understands arbitrary forms where any of the aforementioned
attributes are used.  Therefore, you can for example query for
\"(+ :op-l :cl-l)\".  This query would return the sum of lengths
of opening and closing delimiter.  A query
\"(concat :prefix :op)\" would return the string containing
expression prefix and the opening delimiter.

  "Add a pair definition.

OPEN is the opening delimiter.  Every pair is uniquely determined
by this string.

CLOSE is the closing delimiter.  You can use nil for this
argument if you are updating an existing definition.  In this
case, the old value is retained.

TRIGGER is an optional trigger for the pair.  The pair will be
inserted if either OPEN or TRIGGER is typed.  This is usually
used as a shortcut for longer pairs or for pairs that can't be
typed easily.

ACTIONS is a list of actions that smartparens will perform with
this pair.  Possible values are:

- insert  - autoinsert the closing pair when opening pair is
  typed.
- wrap    - wrap an active region with the pair defined by opening
  delimiter if this is typed while region is active.
- autoskip - if the sexp is active or `sp-autoskip-closing-pair' is
  set to 'always, skip over the closing delimiter if user types its
  characters in order.
- navigate - enable this pair for navigation/highlight and strictness
  checks

If the ACTIONS argument has value :rem, the pair is removed.
This can be used to remove default pairs you don't want to use.
For example: (sp-pair \"[\" nil :actions :rem)

WHEN is a list of predicates that test whether the action
should be performed in current context.  The values in the list
should be names of the predicates (that is symbols, not
lambdas!).  They should accept three arguments: opening
delimiter (which uniquely determines the pair), action and
context.  The context argument can have values:

- string  - if point is inside string.
- comment - if point is inside comment.
- code    - if point is inside code.  This context is only
  recognized in programming modes that define string semantics.

If *any* filter returns t, the action WILL be performed. A number
of filters are predefined: `sp-point-after-word-p',
`sp-point-before-word-p', `sp-in-string-p',
`sp-point-before-eol-p' etc.

When clause also supports a special format for delayed insertion.
The condition is a list with commands, predicates (with three
arguments as regular when form) or strings specifying the last
event.  All three types can be combined in one list.  The pair
will be inserted *after* the next command if it matches the any
command on the list, if the last event matches any string on the
list or if any predicate returns true.  If the pair's :when
clause contains this special form, it will never be immediately
inserted and will always test for delayed insertion.

UNLESS is a list of predicates.  The conventions are the same as
for the WHEN list.  If *any* filter on this list returns t, the
action WILL NOT be performed.  The predicates in the WHEN list
are checked first, and if any of them succeeds, the UNLESS list
is not checked.

Note: the functions on the WHEN/UNLESS lists are also called
\"filters\" in the documentation.

All the filters are run *after* the trigger character is
inserted.

PRE-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called before there
has been some action caused by this pair.  The arguments are the
same as for filters.  Context is relative to the point *before*
the last inserted character.  Because of the nature of the
wrapping operation, this hook is not called if the action is
wrapping.

POST-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called after there
has been some action caused by this pair.  The arguments are the
same as for filters.  Context is relative to current position of
point *after* the closing pair was inserted.

After a wrapping action, the point might end on either side of
the wrapped region, depending on the original direction.  You can
use the variable `sp-last-wrapped-region' to retrieve information
about the wrapped region and position the point to suit your
needs.

A special syntax for conditional execution of hooks is also
supported.  If the added item is a list (function command1
command2...), where funciton is a 3 argument function described
above and command(s) can be either name of a command or a string
representing an event.  If the last command the event as
described by `single-key-description' matches any on the list,
the hook will be executed.  This means these hooks are run not
after the insertion, but after the *next* command is executed.

Example:
  ((lambda (id act con)
     (save-excursion
       (newline))) \"RET\" newline)

This function will move the closing pair on its own line only if
the next command is `newline' or is triggered by RET.  Otherwise
the pairs stay on the same line.

WRAP is a key binding to which a \"wrapping\" action is bound.
The key should be in format that is accepted by `kbd'.  This
option binds a lambda form:

  `(lambda (&optional arg)
     (interactive \"P\")
     (sp-wrap-with-pair ,OPEN))

to the specified key sequence.  The binding is added to global
keymap.  When executed, it wraps ARG (default 1) expressions with
this pair (like `paredit-wrap-round' and friends).  Additionally,
it accepts the same prefix arguments as `sp-select-next-thing'.

BIND is equivalent to WRAP.  It is a legacy setting and will be
removed soon.

INSERT is a key binding to which an \"insert\" action is bound.
The key should be in format that is accepted by `kbd'.  This is
achieved by binding a lambda form:

 (lambda () (interactive) (sp-insert-pair \"pair-id\"))

to the supplied key, where pair-id is the open delimiter of the
pair.  The binding is added to the global map.  You can also bind
a similar lambda manually.  To only bind this in specific major
modes, use this property on `sp-local-pair' instead."

  "Add a local pair definition or override a global definition.

MODES can be a single mode or a list of modes where these settings
should be applied.

PREFIX is a regular expression matching an optional prefix for
this pair in the specified major modes.  If not specified, the
characters of expression prefix syntax class are automatically
considered instead.  This can be used to attach custom prefixes
to pairs, such as prefix \"\\function\" in \\function{arg} in
`LaTeX-mode'.

SUFFIX is a regular expression matching an optional suffix for
this pair in the specified major modes.  If not specified, the
characters of punctuation syntax class are automatically
considered instead.

The rest of the arguments have same semantics as in `sp-pair'.

If the pair is not defined globally, ACTIONS defaults to (wrap
insert) instead of (:add) (which inherits global settings)

The pairs are uniquely identified by the opening delimiter.  If you
replace the closing one with a different string in the local
definition, this will override the global closing delimiter.

The list arguments can optionally be of form starting with
\":add\" or \":rem\" when these mean \"add to the global list\"
and \"remove from the global list\" respectivelly.  Otherwise,
the global list is replaced.  If you wish to both add and remove
things with single call, use \"((:add ...) (:rem ...))\" as an
argument.  Therefore,

  :when '(:add my-test)

would mean \"use the global settings for this pair, but also this
additional test\". If no value is provided for list arguments,
they default to \"(:add)\" which means they inherit the list from
the global definition.

To disable a pair in a major mode, simply set its actions set to
nil. This will ensure the pair is not even loaded when the mode is
activated.

If WRAP is non-nil, the binding is added into major mode keymap
called \"foo-mode-map\".  If the mode does not follow this
convention, you will need to bind the function manually (see
`sp-pair' to how the function is named for each particular pair).
The bindings are not added into `smartparens-mode-map' to prevent
clashes between different modes.

BIND is equivalent to WRAP.  It is a legacy setting and will be
removed soon.

The binding for INSERT follows the same convention as BIND.  See
`sp-pair' for more info.

You can provide a function SKIP-MATCH, that will take three

and end of match.  If this function returns true, the
`sp-get-paired-expression' matcher will ignore this match.  You
can use this to skip over expressions that serve multiple
functions, such as if/end pair or unary if in Ruby or * in
markdown when it signifies list item instead of emphasis.  In

  "Add a tag definition.

MODES is a mode or a list of modes where this tag should
activate.  It is impossible to define global tags.

TRIG is the trigger sequence.  It can be a string of any length.
If more triggers share a common prefix, the shortest trigger is
executed.

OPEN is the format of the opening tag.  This is inserted before
the active region.

CLOSE is the format of the closing tag.  This is inserted after
the active region.

Opening and closing tags can optionally contain the _ character.

If the opening tag contains the _ character, after you type the
trigger, the region is wrapped with \"skeleton\" tags and a
special tag editing mode is entered.  The text you now type is
substituted for the _ character in the opening tag.

If the closing tag contains the _ character, the text from the
opening pair is mirrored to the closing pair and substituted for
the _ character.

TRANSFORM is a function name (symbol) that is called to perform a
transformation of the opening tag text before this is inserted to
the closing tag.  For example, in html tag it might simply select
the name of the tag and cut off the tag attributes (like
class/style etc.).  Defaults to identity.

ACTIONS is a list of actions this tag should support. Currently,
only \"wrap\" action is supported.  Usually, you don't need to
specify this argument.

POST-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called after the
tag is inserted.  If the tag does contain the _ character, these
functions are called after the tag editing mode is exited.  Each
function on this list should accept two arguments: the trigger
string and the action."

If point is inside an inserted pair, and the user only moved
forward with point (that is, only inserted text), if the closing
pair is typed, we shouldn't insert it again but skip forward.  We
call this state \"active sexp\".  The setting
`sp-cancel-autoskip-on-backward-movement' controls when an active
expression become inactive.

For example, pressing ( is followed by inserting the pair (|).  If
we then type 'word' and follow by ), the result should be (word)|
instead of (word)|).

This behaviour can be customized by various settings of
`sp-autoskip-closing-pair' and `sp-autoskip-opening-pair'.

Additionally, this behaviour can be selectively disabled for
specific pairs by removing their \"autoskip\" action.  You can
achieve this by using `sp-pair' or `sp-local-pair' with

Search backward if BACK is non-nil.  This also means, if the
point is inside an expression, this expression is returned.

If `major-mode' is member of `sp-navigate-consider-sgml-tags',
sgml tags will also be considered as sexps in current buffer.  If
`major-mode' is member of `sp-navigate-consider-stringlike-sexp',
expressions where the opening and closing delimiters are the same
will also be considered as sexps.

If the search starts outside a comment, all subsequent comments
are skipped.

If the search starts inside a string or comment, it tries to find
the first balanced expression that is completely contained inside
the string or comment.  If no such expression exist, a warning is
raised (for example, when you comment out imbalanced expression).
However, if you start a search from within a string and the next
complete sexp lies completely outside, this is returned.  Note
that this only works in modes where strings and comments are
properly defined via the syntax tables.

The return value is a plist with following keys:

  :beg    - point in the buffer before the opening
  delimiter (ignoring prefix)
  :end    - point in the buffer after the closing delimiter
  :op     - opening delimiter
  :cl     - closing delimiter
  :prefix - expression prefix

However, you should never access this structure directly as it is
subject to change.  Instead, use the macro `sp-get' which also
provide shortcuts for many commonly used queries (such as length
of opening/closing delimiter or prefix)."
