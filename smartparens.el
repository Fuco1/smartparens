STRUCT is a plist with the format as returned by `sp-get-sexp'.
Which means this macro also works with `sp-get-symbol',
`sp-get-string' and `sp-get-thing'.

ATTR is an attribute we want to query.  Currently supported
attributes are:

:beg       - point in buffer before the opening delimiter
:end       - point in the buffer after the closing delimiter
:beg-in    - point in buffer after the opening delimiter
:end-in    - point in buffer before the closing delimiter
:beg-prf   - point in buffer before the prefix of this expression
:op        - opening delimiter
:cl        - closing delimiter
:op-l      - length of the opening pair
:cl-l      - length of the closing pair
:len       - length of the entire expression, including enclosing
delimiters and the prefix
:len-out   - length of the the pair ignoring the prefix, including
delimiters
:len-in    - length of the pair inside the delimiters
:prefix    - expression prefix
:prefix-l  - expression prefix length

In addition to simple queries, this macro understands arbitrary
forms where any of the aforementioned attributes are used.
Therefore, you can for example query for
\"(+ :op-l :cl-l)\".  This query would return the sum of lengths
of opening and closing delimiter.  A query
\"(concat :prefix :op)\" would return the string containing
expression prefix and the opening delimiter.

This replacement is considered any time when the ATTR argument is
a list and not a single keyword.

2. Local ban - you can ban specific pair in specific modes.  See
`sp-add-local-ban-insert-pair'.

3. Global ban - you can globally ban specific pair.

4. Local allow - you can allow specific pair in specific
modes.  It is disabled in all other modes (as if you globally
banned it first).  See `sp-add-local-allow-insert-pair'.

Additionally, there is a possibility to disable insertion of
pairs inside strings, docstrings and comments or inside code.  The
order in which these are determined is following:

1. Is the pair allowed in this mode? (by the above mechanism)

2. Local ban inside strings - `sp-add-local-ban-insert-pair-in-string'.

3. Global ban - `sp-add-ban-insert-pair-in-string'.

4. Local allow - `sp-add-local-allow-insert-pair-in-string'.

The semantics are the same as above.  First, point position is
tested to determine if it is inside string.  If yes, the rules for
string restrictions are evaluated.  If not, restrictions for code
are evaluated.  The code versions end with \"in-code\" instead of
\"in-string\".

You can disable this feature completely for all modes and all pairs by
setting `sp-autoinsert-pair' to nil.

You can globally disable insertion of closing pair if point is
followed by the matching opening pair.  It is disabled by
default.  See `sp-autoinsert-if-followed-by-same' for more info.

You can globally disable insertion of closing pair if point is
followed by word.  It is disabled by default.  See

determine the opening/closing relation without keeping track of
the content of the entire buffer.

If the search starts outside a comment, all subsequent comments
are skipped.

If the search starts inside a string or comment, it tries to find
the first balanced expression that is completely contained inside
the string or comment.  If no such expression exist, a warning is
raised (for example, when you comment out imbalanced expression).
However, if you start a search from within a string and the next
complete sexp lies completely outside, this is returned.

The return value is a plist with following keys:

  :beg    - point in the buffer before the opening
  delimiter (ignoring prefix)
  :end    - point in the buffer after the closing delimiter
  :op     - opening delimiter
  :cl     - closing delimiter
  :prefix - expression prefix
