STRUCT is a plist with the format as returned by `sp-get-sexp'.

ATTR is an attribute we want to query.  Currently supported
attributes are:

:beg       - point in buffer before the opening delimiter

:beg-in    - point in buffer after the opening delimiter
:end-in    - point in buffer before the closing delimiter
:beg-prf   - point in buffer before the prefix of this expression
:op        - opening delimiter
:cl        - closing delimiter
:op-l      - length of the opening pair
:cl-l      - length of the closing pair
:len       - length of the entire expression, including enclosing
delimiters and the prefix
:len-out   - length of the the pair ignoring the prefix, including
delimiters
:len-in    - length of the pair inside the delimiters
:prefix    - expression prefix
:prefix-l  - expression prefix length

In addition to simple queries, this macro understands arbitrary
forms where any of the aforementioned attributes are used.
Therefore, you can for example query for
\"(+ :op-l :cl-l)\".  This query would return the sum of lengths
of opening and closing delimiter.  A query
\"(concat :prefix :op)\" would return the string containing
expression prefix and the opening delimiter.

OPEN is the opening delimiter.  Every pair is uniquely determined
by this string.

CLOSE is the closing delimiter.  You can use nil for this
argument if you are updating an existing definition.  In this
case, the old value is retained.

ACTIONS is a list of actions that smartparens will perform with
this pair.  Possible values are:

- insert  - autoinsert the closing pair when opening pair is
  typed.
- wrap    - wrap an active region with the pair defined by opening
  delimiter if this is typed while region is active.

If the ACTIONS argument has value :rem, the pair is removed.
This can be used to remove default pairs you don't want to use.
For example: (sp-pair \"[\" nil :actions :rem)

WHEN is a list of predicates that test whether the action
should be performed in current context.  The values in the list
should be names of the predicates (that is symbols, not
lambdas!).  They should accept three arguments: opening
delimiter (which uniquely determines the pair), action and
context.  The context argument can have values:

- string  - if point is inside string or comment.
- code    - if point is inside code.  This context is only
  recognized in programming modes that define string semantics.

If *any* filter returns t, the action WILL be performed.

UNLESS is a list of predicates.  The conventions are the same as
for the WHEN list.  If *any* filter on this list returns t, the
action WILL NOT be performed.  The predicates in the WHEN list
are checked first, and if any of them succeeds, the UNLESS list
is not checked.

Note: the functions on the WHEN/UNLESS lists are also called
\"filters\" in the documentation.

All the filters are run *after* the trigger character is
inserted.

PRE-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called before there
has been some action caused by this pair.  The arguments are the
same as for filters.  Context is relative to the point *before*
the last inserted character.  Because of the nature of the
wrapping operation, this hook is not called if the action is
wrapping.

POST-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called after there
has been some action caused by this pair.  The arguments are the
same as for filters.  Context is relative to current position of
point *after* the closing pair was inserted.

After a wrapping action, the point might end on either side of
the wrapped region, depending on the original direction.  You can
use the variable `sp-last-wrapped-region' to retrieve information
about the wrapped region and position the point to suit your
needs."

The rest of the arguments have same semantics as in `sp-pair'.

If the pair is not defined globally, ACTIONS defaults to (wrap
insert) instead of (:add) (which inherits global settings)

The pairs are uniquely identified by the opening delimiter.  If you
replace the closing one with a different string in the local
definition, this will override the global closing delimiter.

The list arguments can optionally be of form starting with
\":add\" or \":rem\" when these mean \"add to the global list\"
and \"remove from the global list\" respectivelly.  Otherwise,
the global list is replaced.  If you wish to both add and remove
things with single call, use \"((:add ...) (:rem ...))\" as an
argument.  Therefore,

  :when '(:add my-test)

would mean \"use the global settings for this pair, but also this
additional test\". If no value is provided for list arguments,
they default to \"(:add)\" which means they inherit the list from

  "Add a tag definition.

MODES is a mode or a list of modes where this tag should
activate.  It is impossible to define global tags.

TRIG is the trigger sequence.  It can be a string of any length.
If more triggers share a common prefix, the shortest trigger is
executed.

OPEN is the format of the opening tag.  This is inserted before
the active region.

CLOSE is the format of the closing tag.  This is inserted after
the active region.

Opening and closing tags can optionally contain the _ character.

If the opening tag contains the _ character, after you type the
trigger, the region is wrapped with \"skeleton\" tags and a
special tag editing mode is entered.  The text you now type is
substituted for the _ character in the opening tag.

If the closing tag contains the _ character, the text from the
opening pair is mirrored to the closing pair and substituted for
the _ character.

TRANSFORM is a function name (symbol) that is called to perform a
transformation of the opening tag text before this is inserted to
the closing tag.  For example, in html tag it might simply select
the name of the tag and cut off the tag attributes (like
class/style etc.).  Defaults to identity.

ACTIONS is a list of actions this tag should support. Currently,
only \"wrap\" action is supported.  Usually, you don't need to
specify this argument.

POST-HANDLERS is a list of functions that are called after the
tag is inserted.  If the tag does contain the _ character, these
functions are called after the tag editing mode is exited.  Each
function on this list should accept two arguments: the trigger
string and the action."

  "Find the nearest balanced expression that is after (before) point.

Search backward if BACK is non-nil.  This also means, if the
point is inside an expression, this expression is returned.

For the moment, this function (ignores) pairs where the opening and
closing pair is the same, as it is impossible to correctly
determine the opening/closing relation without keeping track of
the content of the entire buffer.

If the search starts outside a comment, all subsequent comments
are skipped.

If the search starts inside a string or comment, it tries to find
the first balanced expression that is completely contained inside
the string or comment.  If no such expression exist, a warning is
raised (for example, when you comment out imbalanced expression).
However, if you start a search from within a string and the next
complete sexp lies completely outside, this is returned.

The return value is a plist with following keys:

  :beg    - point in the buffer before the opening
  delimiter (ignoring prefix)
  :end    - point in the buffer after the closing delimiter
  :op     - opening delimiter
  :cl     - closing delimiter
  :prefix - expression prefix

However, you should never access this structure directly as it is
subject to change.  Instead, use the macro `sp-get' which also
provide shortcuts for many commonly used queries (such as length
of opening/closing delimiter or prefix)."

backward direction.

With ARG being raw prefix \\[universal-argument], kill all the expressions from
point up until the end of current list.  With raw prefix - \\[universal-argument],
kill all the expressions from beginning of current list up until
point.  If point is inside a symbol, this is also killed.  If
there is no expression after/before the point, just delete the
whitespace up until the closing/opening delimiter.

With ARG being raw prefix \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument], kill current list (the list
point is inside).

If ARG is nil, default to 1 (kill single expression forward)

With `sp-navigate-consider-symbols', symbols and strings are also
considered balanced expressions.

Examples.  Prefix argument is shown after the example in
\"comment\". Assumes `sp-navigate-consider-symbols' equal to t:

 (foo |(abc) bar)  -> (foo bar) ;; nil, defaults to 1

 (foo (bar) | baz) -> |         ;; 2

 (foo |(bar) baz)  -> |         ;; \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]

 (1 2 |3 4 5 6)    -> (1 2)     ;; \\[universal-argument]

 (1 |2 3 4 5 6)    -> (1 |5 6)  ;; 3

 (1 2 3 4 5| 6)    -> (1 2 3 6) ;; -2

 (1 2 3 4| 5 6)    -> (5 6)     ;; - \\[universal-argument]
