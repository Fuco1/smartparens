;;; Commentary:

;; This is a default configuration for smartparens package.  If you
;; wish to set up everything by yourself, you can instead require
;; smartparens directly.

;; However, some configuration is always loaded by default, most
;; notably the built-in list of supported pairs.  If you want to erase
;; this list, simply use (setq sp-pairs nil) and then add your own
;; pairs.

;; For more info, see github readme at
;; https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens

;;; Code:

(require 'smartparens)

;; do not autoinsert ' pair if the point is preceeded by word.  This
;; will handle the situation when ' is used as a contraction symbol in
;; natural language.  Nil for second argument means to keep the
;; original definition of closing pair.
(sp-pair "'" nil :unless '(sp-point-after-word-p))

;; emacs is lisp hacking enviroment, so we set up some most common
;; lisp modes too
(sp-with-modes '(
                 emacs-lisp-mode
                 inferior-emacs-lisp-mode
                 lisp-interaction-mode
                 scheme-mode
                 lisp-mode
                 eshell-mode
                 slime-repl-mode
                 clojure-mode
                 common-lisp-mode
                 )
  ;; disable ', it's the quote character!
  (sp-local-pair "'" nil :actions nil)
  ;; also only use the pseudo-quote inside strings where it serve as
  ;; hyperlink.
  (sp-local-pair "`" "'" :when '(sp-in-string-p)))

;; NOTE: Normally, `sp-local-pair' accepts list of modes (or a single
;; mode) as a first argument.  The macro `sp-with-modes' adds this
;; automatically.  If you want to call sp-local-pair outside this
;; macro, you MUST supply the major mode argument.

;; LaTeX modes
(sp-with-modes '(
                 tex-mode
                 plain-tex-mode
                 latex-mode
                 )
  ;; math modes, yay.  The :actions are provided automatically if
  ;; these pairs do not have global definition.
  (sp-local-pair "`" "'")
  (sp-local-pair "$" "$")
  (sp-local-pair "\\[" "\\]")
  (sp-local-tag "\\b" "\\begin{_}" "\\end{_}"))

;; html modes
(sp-local-tag '(sgml-mode html-mode) "<" "<_>" "</_>" :transform 'sp-match-sgml-tags)

(provide 'smartparens-config)
