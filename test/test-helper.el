Each form of FORMS represents a single test.  NAME is suffixed by

Some keyword arguments inside FORMS are interpreted as keys in a
plist:

- :let => A form in a format accepted by first argument of
  `let'.  If non-nil, it wraps every generated test instance and
  can be used to to set up the test environment.
- :init-form => A form run before the test to set up the environment.
- :mode => a symbol of the `major-mode' to activate.  This is a
  convenient shorter form of :init-form.

These forms except :let are not handled by this macro but are
passed to the test forms which are expected to interpret them.
Whether or not these properties are passed to the child form as
keyword arguments is governed by the symbol property
`sp-ert-deftest-keywords', see `get', `put', `symbol-plist'.

If the first non plist key/value argument is a string, it is
interpreted as a docstring and no test case is generated from
it."
